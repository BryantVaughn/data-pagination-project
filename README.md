# Data Pagination and Filtering

This project uses JavaScript to dynamically generate pages of student info cards and display them in the browser. It's built to display 9 cards on each page, and build the appropriate number of pagination buttons depending on the length of the passed in student list.

## Extras

I added search functionality to allow filtering based on student names. Simply type your desired search string into the search field, and the results will update on the page. If there are no student names found containing your search query, a message is displayed on the screen stating so.
